# Blog Migration

After taking down my website due to malware and the general frustration with my hosting serviceâ€™s customer support, I have begun moving my blog here to Git Hub.

Slowly but surely all postings will be moved over. I will be starting with the smaller posts as I try to recreate all of the gifs / graphs / documents / etc for each larger post.

Therefore, posts will continue to appear, but they may not be in contiguous order!

## Notice

I will likely not provide any of the source files here as I do not have a good method for
distributing large amounts of binary data that I feel comfortable with.
